# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems. I'm using this as a way to learn JavaScript and to practice my programming skills.

Completing the programming challenges from the massive Project Euler archives. 
These will harden your algorithm and mathematics knowledge.

These problems range in difficulty and, for many, the experience is inductive chain learning. That is, by solving one problem, 
it will expose you to a new concept that allows you to undertake a previously inaccessible problem. Can you finish them all?
